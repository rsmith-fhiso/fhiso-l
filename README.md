# FHISO Legacy Serialisation (FHISO-L)

*This document is a draft by Richard Smith <`rsmith@fhiso.org`> for
consideration by FHISO.  It is not endorsed by FHISO.*

The Family History Information Standards Organistion's legacy serialisation
(FHISO-L) is a proposed serialisation format and data model for genealogical 
data based on GEDCOM by the Church of Jesus Christ and the Latter-day Saints.
It is intended to be backwards compatible with GEDCOM and include modest 
extensions, some of which are already in use by vendors.
